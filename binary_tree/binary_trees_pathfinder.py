# Coding a pathfinder! Here's how it works:

# This code lets you explore every nook and cranny of a binary tree. Imagine it as a guide on a treasure hunt, tracing every root-to-leaf path and proudly displaying each finding.

# It starts by defining nodes and a tree, then prints all routes from the mighty root to each little leaf. Handy for anyone venturing into tree structures!

# Each node is an adventurer with the power to branch out, left or right. Paths are printed whenever these adventurers meet their final destination - a leaf!

# Input your journey's stops and watch it unveil every path taken in a beautiful order.

# Ever thought of coding as arranging a treasure map? Why not try creating a larger tree next time, and see what new paths unfold?

# Write a program to print all the paths from the root node to the leaf nodes of a given binary tree.
#     *Define a method, print_paths(), which takes two arguments: current_node and path (where path is a list of nodes visited during traversal).
#     *Start from the root and traverse your way down to every leaf node.
#     *While traversing, keep storing the nodes in a list.
#     *Print the list when you reach a leaf node.
#     *Return the list once you have traversed every node.
