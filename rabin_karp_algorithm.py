# .................Introduction..............
# In the Rabin-Karp algorithm, we use hashes of strings to find the matching pattern.
# Rabin-Karp approach compare the pattern with the subtext only if they have equal hash values.

# Let's see how it works next.

# ..............Working of Rabin-Karp Algorithm..............
# Suppose we need to find a pattern of length m in the text string.

# Here is how it works:
    # *Find the hash of the pattern.
    # *Calculate the hash of the substring of the length m in text, starting from the first character.
    # *Compare the hash of the pattern with the hash of the substring to find the match.
    # *Calculate the hash of the next substring of the length m in text, starting from the second character.
    # *Compare the hash of the pattern with the hash of this substring to find the match.
    # *Repeat this process for all substrings of length m in the text string.
# In this algorithm, we compare the entire pattern only after the hash value is matched. This approach reduces redundant comparisons.

# Let's explore this process in detail.

# Before going further, let's look at hashing as it is essential for the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
# We have already covered hashing in the previous chapter. Rabin-Karp uses hashing slightly differently; it uses the concept of rolling hash.

# Next, we'll learn how rolling hash works.

#...................Rolling hash..........................
# Rolling hashing (also known as recursive hashing) is a hashing technique that involves the continuous recalculation of the hash values for the substrings within a text.

# Consider the following example.
# Suppose we have the following text: 
#                 "ABCD".

# Our task is to calculate the hash values of all the substrings of length three.
# To achieve this, we will first assign a hash function to each character of the string.
# Let's assume our hash function assigns the following ASCII values to each character:
#                 65 66 67 68
#                 "A B  C  D".

# Next, we'll calculate the hash value for the initial substring.

# Let's begin by calculating the hash value of the substring "ABC".

#                 65 66 67
#                  A  B  C 

# Hash(ABC) = Hash(A) + Hash(B) + Hash(C) = 65 + 66 + 67 = 198

# Next, we will shift the substring one character to the right. This results in another substring, "BCD".

#                 66 67 68
#                  B  C  D

# Once we have the hash value of one substring, we can easily compute the hash value of a different substring of the same length. Here's how:

# Hash(BCD) = (Hash(ABC) - Hash(A))  + Hash(D) = (198 - 65)  + 68 = 133 + 68 = 201

# In this way, we can calculate the hash values of all substrings of length three.

# Since we are not recalculating the hash value of each character in subsequent steps, using the rolling hash technique improves the performance of string matching algorithms.
# The central purpose of the rolling hash technique is to recalculate hash values for substrings efficiently.
# The rolling hashing method improves the performance by removing redundant calculation of hash values.

#......................The Hash Function......................
# For the Rabin-Karp algorithm, the hash function is defined such that:

#     *The hash value of a string is as unique as possible.
#     *The function can undergo rolling hash.

# We will use this hash function to compute a unique hash value.

    # Hash value = ∑(character_value*base^length-1) mod prime_number

# Here, we select the base value of 256 to include all the characters and a prime number of 101 to reduce the risk of hash collisions.

# Now, let's calculate the hash value for the following substring.

    # Hash value=(65*256^2)+(66*256^1)+(67*256^0)mod101
    # = (65*65536)+(66*256)+67 mod 101
    # = 4259840+16896+67 mod 101
    # = 4276803 mod 101
    # = 59

# So, the hash value for the substring "ABC" is 59.
# Next, we will write a working program to implement hashing.

#................Source code: Rolling Hashing........................
def compute_hash(string, base = 256, prime_number = 101):
   
    # initialize the hash value to 0
    hash_value = 0
    
    # iterate over each character in the string
    for index,char in enumerate(string):
        # get the ASCII value 
        ascii_value = ord(char)
        # calculate the exponent for each character
        exponent = len(string) - index - 1
        # calculate the term for the current character
        term = (ascii_value * pow(base, exponent)) % prime_number
        # update the hash value
        hash_value = (hash_value + term) % prime_number

    return hash_value

string_to_hash = "ABC"

hash_result = compute_hash(string_to_hash)
print(f"The hash value of '{string_to_hash}' is: {hash_result}")


#..................Working of Rabin-Karp Algorithm...............
# Suppose we have the following text:

#       [ABCCDDAEFG]

# And we have to search for the following pattern:
#       [CDD]

# Let's see how we can search for the requied pattern in the text.
# To find the required pattern, we first assign an ASCII value to each character that we will be using in the problem.

# 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74
# A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J

# After this, we align the pattern with the same length of the text.

# Text:  [ABCCDDAEFG]
# Pattern:  [CDD]

# Now, we need to compare the pattern with the first three characters of text, i.e., "ABC".
# The hash value of pattern "CDD" is calculated as:

        # Hash value = (67×256^2)+(68×256^1)+(68×256^0)mod 101
        # =(67×65536)+(68×256)+68mod101
        # =4390912+17408+68mod101
        # =4408488mod101
        # =41

# Here, the hash value for the pattern "CDD" is 41 but that of "ABC" is 59.
# Since the hash values don't match, we then move to the next character.
# Here, the hash value for the pattern "BCC" is 100, but that of "CDD" is 41.
# next character
# Here, the hash value for the pattern "CDD" is 41, but that of "CCD" is 88.
# next character
# Here, the hash values for both the pattern "CDD" and the substring "CDD" is 41, resulting in a match.
# Now, we compare the pattern and the substring just like we did with the brute-force algorithm. As a result, we find that strings do indeed match.
# However, a string can have multiple matches to the same pattern. Therefore, we continue our search and move on to the next character.
# Here, the hash value for the pattern "CDD" is 41, but that of the "DDA" is 25.
# next character
# Here, the hash value for the pattern "CDD" is 41, and that of the "DAE" is 69.
# next character
# Here, the hash values for the pattern "CDD" is 41, and that of "AEF" is 22.
# next character
# Here, the hash value of the pattern "CDD" is 41, and that of "EFG" is 25.
# In this way, we search for the pattern from the given string.


#...............Text Comparison in Rabin Karp..................
# Even though hash values may match, we perform direct character comparison to double-check if the pattern and the substring are similar.

# This is essential because more than one pattern can have the same hash value.

# Let's consider the patterns "ABC" and "CBA" to illustrate this concept:

# We have the ASCII values:
# A=65
# B=66
# C=67

# For pattern "ABC", hash calculation is:

#     = (65 * 256^2) + (66 * 256^1) + (67 * 256^0) mod 101
#     = (65 * 65536) + (66 * 256) + 67 mod 101
#     = 4267009 mod 101
#     = 52

# Similarly for the pattern "CBA", hash calculation is:
    
#     = (67 * 256^2) + (66 * 256^1) + (65 * 256^0) % 101
#     = (67 * 65536) + (66 * 256) + 65 % 101
#     = 4390912 % 101
#     = 52

# Although the hash values match, a character-by-character comparison reveals differences between the patterns.

# If the hash values match but the pattern differs, this is known as spurious hits(false positives).

# Therefore, we have to perform text comparison even after the hash values have matched.


#.............Thought Process: Rabin-Karp Algorithm.................
# Now, let's see how we can implement the Rabin-Karp algorithm in Python.

# 1. Get the text and the pattern.
    # def rabin_karp(text, pattern, base = 256, prime = 101):

# Here, we have defined the rabin_karp() function, which takes in two arguments:

#     *text - the original string
#     *pattern - the pattern to be searched

# Here, we assign a base for the possible characters in the input set and a random prime_number for the modulo operations.

# 2. Initialize the values.
    # pattern_length = len(pattern)
    # text_length = len(text)

# Then, we create variables pattern_length and text_length to store the lengths of the pattern and the text, respectively.

# Similarly, we initialize a list to store occurrences of the pattern in text.
    # occurrences = []

# Also, we have to pre-compute the highest power of base. This is needed to update the hash for the next substring.
    # highest_base_pow = pow(base, pattern_length - 1) % prime

# 3. Calculate the hash value.

# We calculate the hash value of the pattern and the initial segment of the text.

    # pattern_hash = compute_hash(pattern, base, prime_number)
    # substring_hash = compute_hash(text[:m], base, prime_number)

# 4. Compare the pattern and check for a match.

# After calculating the hash values, we compare those hash values and perform character-wise comparisons to confirm the matches.
# If the text patterns match, we add the index of the text to the occurrences list and then move to the next set of characters since our text can have more than one occurrence of the pattern.

    # for i in range(text_length - pattern_length + 1):
    #     if pattern_hash == substring_hash:
    #         # double check to confirm match
    #         if all(text[i + j] == pattern[j] for j in range(pattern_length)):
    #             occurrences.append(i)

# If the text pattern does not match, we simply move on to the next set of characters.

# 5. Update the hash value.

# We then update the hash value for each segment of the text through rolling hash.

# Here, we've used the hashing algorithm, as discussed previously.
    # Hash value=∑(character_value×base ^length−1)modprime_number

# So our rolling hash simply removes the old character's hash value and adds the new character's hash value.

    # if i < text_length - pattern_length:                
        ## update the rolling hash for the next substring
        ## remove first character's hash and add next character's hash-based
    #     substring_hash = (substring_hash - ord(text[i]) * highest_base_pow) * base
    #     substring_hash = (substring_hash + ord(text[i + pattern_length])) % prime
# Next, we will write a working program to implement the Rabin-Karp algorithm.


def compute_hash(string, base = 256, prime = 101):
    
    hash_value = 0

    for index, char in enumerate(string):
        
        ascii_value = ord(char)
        exponent = len(string) - index - 1
        term = (ascii_value * pow(base, exponent)) % prime
        
        hash_value = (hash_value + term) % prime

    return hash_value

def rabin_karp(text, pattern, base = 256, prime = 101):

    pattern_length = len(pattern)
    text_length = len(text)

    # hash of the pattern text (substring)
    pattern_hash = compute_hash(pattern)
    
    # hash of a substring that has the same length as the pattern
    substring_hash = compute_hash(text[: pattern_length])
    
    # initialize a list to store occurrences of the pattern in text
    occurrences = []
    
    # pre-compute the highest power of base
    # this is needed to update the hash for the next substring
    highest_base_pow = pow(base, pattern_length - 1) % prime

    # loop through all possible substrings of text with pattern length
    for i in range(text_length - pattern_length + 1):
        
        # compare hash of substring and pattern
        if pattern_hash == substring_hash:
            
            # double check to confirm match
            if all(text[i + j] == pattern[j] for j in range(pattern_length)):
                occurrences.append(i)
                
        # update the hash of the next substring using the previous hash
        if i < text_length - pattern_length:
            
            # update the rolling hash for the next substring
            # remove first character's hash and add next character's hash-based
            substring_hash = (substring_hash - ord(text[i]) * highest_base_pow) * base
            substring_hash = (substring_hash + ord(text[i + pattern_length])) % prime
            
    return occurrences

# example usage
text = "CODEWITHCODER"
pattern = "CODE"
occurrences = rabin_karp(text, pattern)


print(len(text))
for occurrence in occurrences:
    end_index = occurrence + len(pattern) - 1
    print(f"Matching pattern: index {occurrence} to {end_index}.")

if occurrences:
    print(f"The pattern found at indices: {occurrences}.")
else:
    print("The pattern is not present in the text.")



#...........Limitation of Rabin-Karp Algorithm................
# As we've discussed, the Rabin-Karp algorithm can sometimes give false matches because different substrings have the same hash value as the pattern.

# Even though the algorithm tries to fix this by checking the matches character by character, it's not very efficient. This is especially true when there are many substrings with the same hash value as the pattern.

# This extra work of comparing characters adds to the algorithm's computational load, especially when dealing with large texts or patterns. So, while Rabin-Karp can handle these false matches, its reliance on text comparison can slow it down.
