# ..............Applications of Postorder Traversal..........
# Postorder traversal is ideal for problems where processing a node relies on the results from its children. While its applications are vast, here are some common use cases:

# 1.........Tree Deletion.........
# Postorder traversal is often used for deleting all nodes in a tree. It ensures that child nodes are deleted before their parents, minimizing the risk of memory leaks.
# This is especially useful in languages without automatic garbage collection.

# 2.........Dynamic Programming.........
# Dynamic Programming is a powerful technique for solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems.
# Postorder traversal is commonly used in tree-based dynamic programming, as it allows you to solve child subproblems before tackling the parent node.

# We will cover dynamic programming later in another course.
