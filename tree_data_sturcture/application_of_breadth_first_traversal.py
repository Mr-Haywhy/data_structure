# ...........Application of Breadth-First Traversal...........
# Breadth-first traversal is used in scenarios when we need to process all of the outcomes for a current node before processing the outcome of the branch nodes.

# The most common use of this traversal is in Game Trees used by the computer software to play games against the user.

# For example, let's use a tree to show the possible choices of moves that might be made by a player during a game Tic-Tac-Toe.

# NOTE: Constructing a complete game tree demands significant computational resources. The standard approach is to use a partial game tree, showing outcomes only up to a certain depth.

# Here,
#     *Root represents the initial configuration of the game.
#     *Level 1 consists of all the possible moves of Player 1.
#     *Level 2 consists of the possible moves of Player 2 in response to Player 1.

# Breadth-first traversal is useful here because it allows us to evaluate all possible moves from the current board state before considering subsequent moves.

# This is what computers use to calculate the best possible move in board games.
