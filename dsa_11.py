#......................LINKED LIST.............................#
# A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected elements. Each element of a linked list is called a node.
# A node stores data and the address of the next node.
# A linked list is a series of connected nodes.
    # The first node is the starting point of a linked list and is called the head of that linked list.
    # The address of the last node must point to None (null), as there are no elements after it.
# 
# ...............Real-Life Analogy.................#
# Imagine playing a game of Treasure Hunt, where you follow a trail of clues connecting one piece of information to the next until you finally reach the treasure.
# A linked list is analogous to this trail of connected clues. And each clue (node) has
    # a piece of information (data)
    # a hint to find the next clue (address of the next node)
# 
# 
#....................CREATING A LINKED LIST..................#
# Since a linked list is a collection of connected nodes, let's first learn to create nodes.
#...........Create a Node.............#
# As mentioned before, a node stores data and the address of the next node.
            # 
            # class Node:
                # def __init__(self, data):   
                #     self.data = data
                #     self.next = None
# NOTE: We have initialized the value of next to None because, currently, there are no nodes after it.
# 
# Now, we can create nodes and add data to them.
            # node1 = Node(11)
            # node2 = Node(2)
            # node3 = Node(88)
# 
# Next, we will create a linked list by connecting the nodes above
# 
# Let's create a LinkedList class to implement linked lists.
            # class LinkedList:
            #     def __init__(self):
            #         # initialize the head field to None
            #         self.head = None
# 
# Next, we will create a method to add nodes. For now, we will only add our first node to the linked list.
            # def create_linked_list(self):
            #     # create the first node
            #     node1 = Node(80)
            #     # set the head field to the first node
            #     self.head = node1
# 
# Let's create the second node.
            # def create_linked_list(self):
            #     # create the first node
            #     node1 = Node(80)
            #     # set the head field to the first node
            #     self.head = node1
            #     # create the second node
            #     node2 = Node(9)
            #     # link the first and second nodes
            #     node1.next = node2
# 
# Here, we have created a node named node2 with value 9. We then linked it with node1 by assigning node2 to the next field of node1.
# 
# Let's add the third node as well.
            # def create_linked_list(self):
            # # create the first node
                # node1 = Node(80)
            # # set the head field to the first node
                # self.head = node1
            # # create the second node
                # node2 = Node(9)
            # # link the first and second nodes
                # node1.next = node2
            # # create the third node
                # node3 = Node(14)
            # # link the second and third nodes
                # node2.next = node3
# 
# 
    # The head is the first node in the linked list.
    # Each node is connected to each other.
    # The last node points to None.


# create the Node class
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# create the LinkedList class
class LinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None

    # method to create a linked list
    # a linked list of three nodes:
    # 80->9->14
    def create_linked_list(self):

        # create and link nodes
        node1 = Node(80)
        self.head = node1

        node2 = Node(9)
        node1.next = node2

        node3 = Node(14)
        node2.next = node3

linked_list = LinkedList()

# create linked list
linked_list.create_linked_list()



#..............TRAVERSE THROUGH THE LINKED LIST.............#
# We will now access each node one by one in a linked list.
# NOTE: We cannot access elements in a linked list directly using an index, as we would with a Python list. That's why we need to traverse the linked list to access its elements.
#.....How to traverse through a linked list?.....#
# We will start our traversal from the head node. Then, we will move toward the next element and repeat this process until the next element points to None.
# 
# 1. Assign head to the current variable.
        # get the address to the head of the list
        # current = self.head
# 
# 2. Iterate until the current variable is None.
        # iterate until current is None
        # current is updated to the next node in each iteration

        # while current:
        #     current = current.next
# 
# If current.next is None, we know for sure that it is the last node.
# 
# Let's add a method to our LinkedList class that will be used for traversal.
# 
# 
# method to traverse and print a linked list
def traverse_linked_list(self):
    current = self.head
    while current:
        print(f"{current.data}", end="->")
        current = current.next
    print(None)



#........Count Number of Node..........#
# method to count elements in a linked list
def count_node(self):
    current = self.head
    # initialize count to zero
    count = 0
    while current:
        count += 1
        current = current.next
    return count


#.............Sum of Node............#
def calculate_node_sum(self):
    current = self.head
    sum = 0
    while current:
        sum = current.data
        current = current.next
    return sum



# Here are some tips on how you can improve:

# Ensure correct use of object instances.
# Carefully follow linked list structure.
