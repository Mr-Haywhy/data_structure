Introduction
Breadth-First Search is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph layer by layer.

Real-Life Analogy

When you post a photo or a status update on social media, your immediate friends or followers see it first.

When they like, share, or comment on it, their friends (who might not be directly connected to you) see it, and then their friends, and so on. The post reaches people in layers of closeness to you.

The BFS algorithm works in a similar manner. It starts from a source vertex and explores all its adjacent vertices at the current depth before moving on to the vertices at the next depth level.
