~ Introduction
Graph-based algorithms provide us with techniques for working with graphs to gather valuable understandings and solve complex problems effectively.

These algorithms help us perform various tasks such as:
    * determining the quickest route between two points
    * finding connected components in a network
    * discovering trends in data
    * solving mazes
    * solving practical exercises in artificial intelligence and machine learning.

~ Graph Based Algorithm
In this chapter, you will learn about the following graph-based algorithms:
    * Topological Sorting
    * Dijkstra's Algorithm
    * Bellman Ford's Algorithm
    * Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
    * Kruskal's Algorithm
    * Prim's Algorithm
