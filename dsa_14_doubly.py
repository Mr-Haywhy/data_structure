#...................Doubly linked list....................#
# 
# Normally, in a linked list, every node points to its next node.
# However, we can also create a linked list where a node points to both its previous and next elements. This type of linked list is called a doubly linked list.
# For convenience, we will also take reference to the last node, which we will call the tail node.
# 
#.................Why Doubly linked lists.................#
# Imagine you're designing a text editor where users can enter and edit text.
# Now, suppose you want to add the undo and redo options. This requires moving through the memory in both directions.
# Unfortunately, singly linked lists only move in a single direction, i.e., forward:
# As a result, we can't perform an undo operation using a singly linked list.
# Instead, we need to start from scratch and go through each step, which results in O(n) time complexity and is thus not ideal.
# There's a simple and elegant solution: the doubly linked list.
# Each node points to the next and previous nodes, forming a two-way chain.
# This speeds up redo (O(1)) and undo (O(1))â€”a game-changer in real-time text edits.
# Doubly linked lists find applications beyond text editors, including task scheduling, cache management, and doubly ended queue implementations.
# 
#..............Create a doubly linked list.................#
# As we know, in a regular linked list:
    # Each node contains a reference to the next node.
    # The last node points to None.
# To convert this regular linked list to a doubly linked list, we will:

# 1. Add reference to the previous node to each node.
    # previous
    # Data
    # Next
# 
# 2. Add a tail pointer.
# A tail pointer is similar to the head pointer; it just points to the last node in the linked list.
# 
# After we have added the tail pointer, we will:
    # Make the next pointer of tail point to None.
    # Make the previous pointer of head point to None.

# 
#..............Thought Process: Create a Doubly Linked list....................#
# To implement a doubly linked list, we'll modify our single linked list code by adding a reference to the previous node in each node in our Node class.'
# 
# NOTE:To maintain the doubly linked structure, a node in a list requires references to both the next and previous nodes.
# 
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        # initialize a node with
        # data and next pointer
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

        # add a prev pointer to
        # convert to doubly linked list
        self.prev = None
# 
# Then, we'll add a tail pointer in our class to handle the list.
# 
class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
# 
#..................Traverse Doubly Linked List....................#
# Traversing a doubly linked list is the same as traversing a singly linked list. You move node by node until you reach None.
# The key distinction here from a regular linked list is that a doubly linked list can also be traversed backward. This is known as reverse traversal.
# 
#...............Reverse Traverse a Doubly Linked List..............#
# In reverse traversal, we start from the tail and traverse backward using prev until we reach None.
