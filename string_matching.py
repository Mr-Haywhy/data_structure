# ..............String Matching.......................
# A string is a sequence of characters enclosed within quotation marks. For example, "Hello world", "Data Structure", etc.
# String-matching, also known as string searching, refers to the process of finding a specific string or pattern within a text string.
# For example, finding the "WO" string within the "HELLO WORLD" string.

# ..........example.........
# Consider the string "ABCDABDCBADAB".
# Now, suppose we want to find the pattern "AB" that repeats within the string.
# The figure below shows the pattern "AB" appearing in the text.
#         ___   ___      ___
#         |AB|CD|AB|DCBAD|AB|

# We can see that the "AB" pattern repeats three times within our text.
# String-matching is an important concept with many applications, including text editing, DNA analysis, and computer security.

# String Matching Algorithms
# In this chapter, we'll learn about the following three types of string-matching algorithms:
#     *Brute-force method
#     *Rabin-Karp string-matching algorithm
#     *Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm
